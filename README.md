Pick a Kaggle competition from the following list. You have the choice of completing a regression problem, a classification problem, or an NLP problem involving either classification or sentiment analysis. Perform some EDA, and fit and evaluate at least two models on the dataset you've chosen.

## Problem Statement (from Kaggle)

If you're in Northern California, you'll be walking past the inevitable bushels of leafy greens, spiked with dark purple kale and the bright pinks and yellows of chard. Across the world in South Korea, mounds of bright red kimchi greet you, while the smell of the sea draws your attention to squids squirming nearby. Indiaâ€™s market is perhaps the most colorful, awash in the rich hues and aromas of dozens of spices: turmeric, star anise, poppy seeds, and garam masala as far as the eye can see.

Some of our strongest geographic and cultural associations are tied to a region's local foods. This playground competitions asks you to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients. 

## Guidelines

We know this is a short time for a project. We're not expecting anything as polished as project two or three. However, the goal is for you to have something to show for your time. At a minimum, do some EDA and have at least two models fit and scored.

## Rubric

When evaluated against the rubric, we'll take into account that that you had a very limited amount of time to work on this project. Do your best with the time you have.

Scores will be out of 18 points based on the 6 categories in the rubric.

3 points per section.

| Score | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| **0** | *Project fails to meet the minimum requirements for this item.* |
| **1** | *Project meets the minimum requirements for this item, but falls significantly short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **2** | *Project exceeds the minimum requirements for this item, but falls short of portfolio-ready expectations.* |
| **3** | *Project meets or exceeds portfolio-ready expectations; demonstrates a thorough understanding of every outlined consideration.* |

### Data Cleaning and EDA

- Are missing values imputed/handled appropriately?
- Are distributions examined and described?
- Are outliers identified and addressed?
- Are appropriate summary statistics provided?
- Are steps taken during data cleaning and EDA framed appropriately?

### Visualizations

- Are sufficient visualizations provided?
- Do plots accurately demonstrate valid relationships?
- Are plots labeled properly?
- Are plots interpreted appropriately?
- Are plots formatted and scaled appropriately for inclusion in a notebook-based technical report?

### Preprocessing and Modeling

- Are categorical variables appropriately handled?
- Does the student properly split and/or sample the data for validation/training purposes?
- Does the student utilize feature selection to remove noisy or multi-collinear features?
- Does the student test and evaluate a variety of models to identify a production algorithm?
- Does the student defend their choice of production model relevant to the data at hand and the problem?
- Does the student explain how the model works and evaluate its performance successes/downfalls?

### Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding

- Does the student accurately identify and explain the baseline score?
- Does the student select and use metrics relevant to the problem objective?
- Does the student interpret the results of their model for purposes of inference?
- Is domain knowledge demonstrated when interpreting results?

### Project Organization

- Are modules imported correctly (using appropriate aliases)?
- Does the README provide a good executive summary of the project?
- Is markdown formatting used appropriately to structure notebooks?
- Are there an appropriate amount of comments to support the code?
- Are files & directories organized correctly?
- Are there unnecessary files included?
- Do files and directories have well-structured, appropriate, consistent names?

### Python Syntax and Control Flow

- Is care taken to write human readable code?
- Is the code syntactically correct (no runtime errors)?
- Does the code generate desired results (logically correct)?
- Does the code follows general best practices and style guidelines?
- Are Pandas and sklearn functions used appropriately?
